## The Problem

Your AI agents need to access user data across multiple platforms. Traditional OAuth forces you to:
- Implement authentication for each service separately
- Manage tokens, refresh flows, and complex permission systems
- Build custom approval systems for sensitive actions
- Handle different auth patterns across every platform
- Watch users abandon complex auth flows

## The Solution

Vaultkit provides unified authentication for AI agents with:
- **No OAuth implementation needed** - One integration for all data sources
- **Human-in-the-loop approvals** - Built-in approval workflows with push notifications
- **Consistent API** - Same interface across GitHub, Google, Slack, and more
- **Complete audit trails** - Every access logged and user-controlled

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { Vaultkit } from '@vaultkit/client';

const vault = new Vaultkit({ 
  agentId: process.env.VAULTKIT_AGENT_ID 
});

// No OAuth setup needed - just query user data
const repos = await vault.query({
  userId: 'user_123', // Required: which user's data to access
  resource: 'github:repos'
});

// Built-in approval system with push notifications
const approval = await vault.requestApproval({
  userId: 'user_123', // Required: which user to ask for approval
  action: 'send_sms',
  details: { to: '+1234567890', message: 'Meeting reminder' },
  context: 'Customer support automation'
});

if (approval.granted) {
  await sendSMS(approval.details);
}
```
