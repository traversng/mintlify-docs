## How Vaultkit Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your User Connects Once">
    You send users to Vaultkit's connection flow where they:
    - Connect all their services (GitHub, Google, Slack, etc.) in one place
    - Choose how they want to be notified (SMS, email, push)
    - Set approval preferences
    
    ```javascript
    // You'll redirect users to connect their accounts
    const connectUrl = vault.getConnectUrl({
      userId: 'user_123',
      services: ['github', 'google', 'slack'],
      redirectUrl: 'https://yourapp.com/connected'
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="You Query Their Data">
    After connection, just use their userId to access any connected service:
    
    ```javascript
    // No OAuth tokens to manage
    const repos = await vault.query({
      userId: 'user_123',
      resource: 'github:repos'
    });
    
    const calendar = await vault.query({
      userId: 'user_123',
      resource: 'google:calendar'
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Users Approve Sensitive Actions">
    When your agent needs to take action, users get instant notifications:
    
    ```javascript
    const approval = await vault.requestApproval({
      userId: 'user_123',
      action: 'send_email',
      details: { to: 'boss@company.com', subject: 'Report' }
    });
    
    if (approval.granted) {
      // User approved via push notification
      await sendEmail(approval.details);
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Full Integration Example

Here's what building an AI assistant looks like with Vaultkit:

```javascript
import { Vaultkit } from '@vaultkit/client'; // Coming January 2025
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const vault = new Vaultkit({
  agentId: process.env.VAULTKIT_AGENT_ID,
  apiKey: process.env.VAULTKIT_API_KEY
});

// 1. Connect user's accounts (one-time)
app.get('/connect', (req, res) => {
  const connectUrl = vault.getConnectUrl({
    userId: req.user.id,
    services: ['github', 'google', 'slack'],
    redirectUrl: 'https://myapp.com/connected'
  });
  res.redirect(connectUrl);
});

// 2. User returns after connecting everything
app.get('/connected', (req, res) => {
  // User has connected all services and set notification preferences
  res.send('âœ… All services connected! Your AI assistant is ready.');
});

// 3. Your AI agent can now access their data
app.get('/analyze', async (req, res) => {
  // Get data from multiple services with one SDK
  const data = await vault.query({
    userId: req.user.id,
    resources: ['github:repos', 'slack:messages', 'google:calendar']
  });
  
  // Your AI analyzes the data
  const insights = await analyzeWithAI(data);
  
  // Need to take action? Get approval first
  const approval = await vault.requestApproval({
    userId: req.user.id,
    action: 'send_slack_message',
    details: {
      channel: '#team',
      message: `Based on your repos, here's a summary: ${insights}`
    },
    context: 'Weekly code analysis'
  });
  
  if (approval.granted) {
    await sendSlackMessage(approval.details);
    res.json({ success: true, message: 'Analysis sent to Slack!' });
  } else {
    res.json({ success: false, reason: approval.reason });
  }
});
```

## What Makes This Powerful

1. **No OAuth Implementation**: You never touch OAuth. Vaultkit handles GitHub, Google, Slack, and more.

2. **No Token Management**: No refresh tokens, no expiration handling, no storage concerns.

3. **Built-in Approvals**: Users get push notifications automatically. No Twilio setup needed.

4. **One SDK for Everything**: Add new services by changing a string, not implementing new OAuth flows.

## Pricing

- **$0.01 per API request** - Only pay for what you use
- **Free tier** - 1,000 requests/month during beta
- **No per-seat fees** - Scale with your users
